# Zeroconf Registry plugin for go-micro

This simple plugin implements a zeroconf compliant registry for service discovery in the
(go-micro)[https://github.com/micro/go-micro] ecosystem. Currently in use for an on-premise gRPC
based IoT project, allowing Android clients to easily find a set of go-micro services.
