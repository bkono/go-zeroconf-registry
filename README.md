# Zeroconf Registry plugin for go-micro

This simple plugin implements a zeroconf compliant registry for service discovery in the
[go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) ecosystem. Currently in use for an on-premise gRPC
based IoT project, allowing Android clients to easily find a set of go-micro services. 

The counterpart for the react-native app is just getting started at [react-native-zeroconf-registry](https://github.com/bkono/react-native-zeroconf-registry). Keep an eye out for updates to the readme. While this registry is actively being used, a few more revisions might be necessary as the react-native module iterates forward. Will update this README and an example repo when that one is stablized.
